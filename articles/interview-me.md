Interviews are both a very time-consuming (for company and candidate) and a very noisy (as measured by correlation with job performance) way to evaluate candidates.

There's just something that really doesn't sit right with me about investing so much time in improving my ability to navigate the interview process of getting a job instead of just actually getting better at doing the job.

I also personally don't remember most of the things I used to know anymore, even though I'm confident I could revisit them and get back up to speed much quicker than someone who never learned them at all. But interviewing me isn't going to tell you that.

Here's my attempt to help you get a better sense of my knowledge and capabilities. You can ask a question and using my knowledge base (i.e. things I've learned at some point) exclusively, this tool will generate an answer. It will also provide citations to the exact sources of that information.

<!-- Questions database. Way to identify similar questions -->

<!-- Knowledge sources include 6.036 Notes -->

However, I'm not going to pretend I understood everything perfectly even when I first learned it. I've scored different knowledge sources based on my own subjective assessment of how well I understood it at the time as well as any quantitative external evaluations.

What this means in practice is that any answers that are based on material that I never fully understood in the first place will be caveated as such.

*WILL ADD TOOL HERE*

It's very important to me that any role I work in is a good mutual fit.
Here are some of the main dimensions I think about when evaluating potential opportunities:

<details>
<summary>Role Match</summary>
There should be a way for (what I'm good at (underline this) + what I want to do: DS,PM,MLE,SWE) to have significant value to the business.

I'm not opposed to roles where my responsibilities are more typical of a PM or SWE if it's clear to both me and the company that I can still do a good job.

There are a lot of companies out there doing cool stuff but the nature of their business doesn't really leave a way for me to contribute meaningfully. 

I've talked to many companies where this was the case, could've saved both parties a lot of time.

What I'm good at: Machine Learning, Statistics, Programming (<a href="article_other.html?id=skills/python">Python</a>, SQL), 
Non-technical: Communication, Data Analysis, XFN Collaboration

<summary>Intellectually Stimulating Work</summary>
While this is pretty closely related to the previous point, I wanted to highlight it separately to emphasize its importance.

The easiest way to motivate me is to have a way for me to work on stuff that excites me. To get a better sense of what kinds of problems interest me, you can read this post (underline) or check out the projects section of my website (link).

<summary>People and Culture</summary>
I want to work with people who are really good at what they do and will help me get better at what I want to do. This means talent-density matters but so does being empathetic and supportive (not just knowing what it takes to help me grow but actually being willing to put in the work to help me get there).

Brilliant jerks aren't really my vibe. I want to be around people who I can work with without it feeling like a chore, who are nice and easy to talk to.

Other traits that come to mind: reliable, curious, organized, ambitious, good communicators, proactive

<summary>Useful/Cool Products</summary>

It'd be nice to be able to work somewhere where I can help people. This doesn't necessary mean curing cancer - even just contributing to a product that contributes positively to people's lives and that they enjoy using is fulfilling for me.

In other words, if someone asks me: "Why does your work matter?", I should be able to give a clear and concise answer.

A non-exhaustive list of things that I think fall in this category: Google Maps, Letterboxd, Notion, Reddit, Wikipedia, StockClubs, Material Security, Alma, Swiftly, WorkWhile, Spotify

More broadly, my interests include transit/mobility, personal finance, human connection, healthcare, climate, education, trust and safety, recruiting (helping people find jobs), productivity-enhancing tools, and more.

<summary>Learn/Grow</summary>
...

I'd like to have opportunities to learn and grow. 
What's the path to getting better at what I do and learning new skills?

As I get more tenured, people management/leadership. 

Both in my current role and in many of my personal projects, I've found that I can be more effective by leveraging the strengths of others. A role in which I'm in a position to do more than just my own thing would be great. (TikTok MARS example project)

<details>
<summary>Flexibility and WLB</summary>

Flexibility in terms of what I can work on and when/where I work. I should have some say in what I work on. Top-down management thumbs down.

Similarly, I don't want my time to be micro-managed. There will be some days where I'm more energized and can get a lot done, and some days where I'm not. As long as I'm getting stuff done and I'm always available whenever I'm needed, I'd prefer not to have arbitrary schedule restrictions on top of that.


I don't mind working hard and I'd like to be in a place where I care enough about what I'm doing to want to work hard. At the same time though, I also want to have the ability to pursue both intellectual and recreational interests outside of work, and spend meaningful time with the people I care about.

On Python: Since I first started using it in Feb 2019, I've written ~100k lines of Python code and vibe-coded maybe another ~50k lines.


At work, this Python coding has mostly been for ML/data and web-scraping applications.
Outside of that though, through a few intro classes, some small side projects, and a lot of reading (Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, etc.), I've been able to use it for a lot of other stuff.

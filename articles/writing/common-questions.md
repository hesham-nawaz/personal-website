# Frequently Asked Questions

This section aims to address some of the most common questions I receive. If you have a question that isn't listed here, feel free to reach out to me directly.

### Q: What do you do as a Data Scientist?

<!-- A: As a Data Scientist, my primary role is to extract insights from data to inform business decisions. This involves collecting, processing, and analyzing large datasets to identify trends, patterns, and correlations. I also develop predictive models and machine learning algorithms to solve complex problems. -->

### Q: How did you get into Data Science?

<!-- A: My journey into Data Science began with a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics. I pursued a double major in Mathematics and Data Science, followed by a Master's degree in Computer Science. Throughout my academic career, I worked on various projects that involved data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. These experiences helped me develop the skills necessary to transition into a Data Science role. -->

### Q: What programming languages do you use?

<!-- A: My primary programming languages are Python, R, and SQL. I also have experience with Julia, MATLAB, and Java. The choice of language often depends on the specific project requirements and the type of analysis needed. -->

### Q: Can you help me with my project/data analysis?

<!-- A: I'd be happy to help! Please reach out to me with a brief description of your project, including the goals, data sources, and any specific challenges you're facing. I'll do my best to provide guidance or point you in the right direction. -->

### Q: Do you have any advice for someone starting out in Data Science?

<!-- A: Yes, I do! My advice would be to start by building a strong foundation in statistics, linear algebra, and programming. Practice with real-world datasets and explore different tools and technologies. Networking with professionals in the field can also be incredibly valuable. Finally, stay curious and keep learning â€“ the field of Data Science is constantly evolving. -->

### Q: How do you stay current with new developments in Data Science?

<!-- A: I make it a point to regularly read industry blogs, research papers, and books. I also attend conferences, meetups, and webinars to stay informed about the latest advancements and network with peers. Additionally, I participate in online forums and discussion groups to stay engaged with the Data Science community. -->

### Q: Can I collaborate with you on a project?

<!-- A: I'm always open to collaborating on projects that align with my interests and expertise. Please reach out to me with a project proposal, including the objectives, scope, and expected outcomes. If it's a good fit, we can discuss the details further. -->

### Q: How do I get into MIT?

I'm not an admissions officer but my best guess for what MIT is looking for is the following (roughly in order of importance):

1. Exceptional academic achievement (GPA, standardized test scores, other academic awards)
2. Olympiads (IMO, IPho, ICho, IBO, IOI)
3. Research experience
4. Science fairs (Intel ISEF, Siemens, etc.)
5. Cool independent projects (e.g. an app that got a lot of users)

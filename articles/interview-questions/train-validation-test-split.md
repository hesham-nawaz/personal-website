Understanding Train-Validation-Test Split

What's the goal?

We want to build a good model and we want to know how good our model is.

<b> Simple explanation </b>
<br>
Training set if for training the model.
Validation set is for tuning the hyperparameters and selecting the best model.
Test set is for figuring out how good our model is.

Training set

The features and our target variable are related in some way. An ML model is just a function that aims to capture this relationship in some way. Functions have parameters, and the model uses the training data to learn the best parameters for capturing the relationship between the features and the target variable.

The primary purpose of having separate training, validation, and testing sets is to effectively build, tune, and evaluate machine learning models while ensuring they generalize well to new, unseen data. Each set serves a specific function:

1. Training Set
Purpose: Used to train the model by learning the patterns and relationships between features and the target variable.

Process:

The model iteratively adjusts its parameters to minimize the error between its predictions and the actual outcomes.

Importance:

Essential for the model to learn effectively and represent underlying patterns.

Typically the largest subset, often ~60-80% of the available data.

2. Validation Set
Purpose: Used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

Process:

After training, the model is evaluated against the validation set to measure performance.

Helps choose optimal hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization, model complexity) without biasing toward test performance.

Importance:

Avoids overfitting the model to the training data.

Enables adjustments based on unbiased performance feedback.

Typically ~10-20% of the data.

3. Testing Set
Purpose: Provides an unbiased evaluation of the final model’s generalization performance.

Process:

Applied once, at the very end, after training and hyperparameter tuning are complete.

Offers a fair estimate of how the model will perform on truly unseen data.

Importance:

Ensures the model’s generalizability and reliability.

Typically ~10-20% of data.

Why separate into three sets?
Preventing Overfitting:

If you use the same dataset for both training and evaluation, your model might simply memorize the data rather than learn generalized patterns.

Hyperparameter Tuning Without Leakage:

If hyperparameters are tuned using the test set, the test set’s independence is compromised, and its estimate becomes overly optimistic.

Unbiased Evaluation:

Ensuring the test set remains unseen during training and tuning maintains the integrity of the evaluation, leading to realistic performance estimates.

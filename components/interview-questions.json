    "answer": "Train-test split is used to evaluate model performance on unseen data. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set evaluates how well the model generalizes to new data, helping detect overfitting.",

    "question": "What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?",
    "answer": "L1 regularization (Lasso) adds the absolute value of coefficients as a penalty term, which can lead to sparse models by driving some coefficients to zero. L2 regularization (Ridge) adds the squared magnitude of coefficients, which shrinks all coefficients but rarely to zero.",

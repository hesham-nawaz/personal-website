                        Hi there, I'm Hesham!
                        <br><br>
                        I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at TikTok in the Trust & Safety space.
                        <br><br>
                        <!-- Add ability to hover over any of these to learn more -->
                        Before that, I graduated from MIT with a double major in Mathematics and Data Science, as well as a Master's degree in Computer Science. I've previously worked at Shopify, Nike and several different startups.
                        <br><br>
                        Some of my areas of technical expertise include programming, machine learning, statistics and data analysis.
                        <br><br>
                        I also really enjoy working cross-functionally, contributing to product & strategy discussions and supporting the growth of others.
